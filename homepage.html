        <h3> Self-introduction </h3>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Oh Huijin, currently studying web development. 
          My aim is to create websites that are easy to use and look great. 
          I've learned HTML and CSS to help me achieve this goal, and I've already built some web pages using these skills. 
          In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, going for walks, drawing, and exercising. 
          Drawing, especially, has made me interested in design. 
          Taking this web development course has made me even more passionate about creating effective web designs.
        </p>
        <h3> My background & Education</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a student at Seoul University of Science and Technology, majoring in ITM, class of '22. 
          Our department focuses on training future global IT leaders who understand both IT and business. 
          We even have a dual-degree program with the University of Northumbria in the UK. 
          I'm excited to use my business knowledge to offer useful IT services to many people. 
          I've also participated in IT competitions, suggesting app ideas that could benefit specific businesses.
        </p>
        <h3> My experience </h3>
        <p>
          Through various projects in my major courses, I've gained valuable experience. 
          For example, in my IT investment analysis class, 
          I analyzed the potential success of the Apple Ring using methods like EA B/C and AHP. 
          I also improved my programming skills by creating a drawing program in Java for my Data Structures course. 
          I was responsible for designing features, implementing them, and documenting the process. 
          Participating in IT competitions helped me propose new IT services and evaluate their profitability, leading to some winning experiences. 
          These projects allowed me to apply what I learned in my courses and deepen my understanding of business and development concepts. 
          Overall, the process of generating ideas and analyzing their feasibility was incredibly rewarding. 
          Seeing the program take shape as each function was completed was truly fulfilling.
        </p>
