              I have studied Java, Python, and C languages through courses in the ITM department. 
              I have undertaken various projects such as creating a drawing program in Java, 
              plotting graphs in Python, and attempting hacking in C as part of my coursework.
              Although my skills are still lacking, 
              I aspire to become someone who can fill the progress bar above with continuous effort.

              I have a keen interest in design. I enjoy organizing various materials into a single, 
              neat document. When creating PowerPoint presentations, 
              I invest a lot of time to make them visually appealing and strive to compile 
              class materials into concise notes. 
              Additionally, I have improved my office skills by using Excel for financial calculations 
              in courses such as IT investment analysis and fundamental of finance.

              I enjoy collaborating with others to create excellent results. 
              While conflicts may arise during the process of reconciling various opinions and receiving feedback, 
              I believe such conflicts contribute to producing better outcomes. 
              I actively participate in cooperation, provide and receive feedback, 
              and maintain a respectful and flexible attitude toward others' opinions.
